    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles, undrained, such as Ro*Tel®</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>4 ounces processed cheese product, such as Velveeta®, cubed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>4 ounces Colby Jack cheese, shredded (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>12 ounces uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spray a 6-quart slow cooker with cooking spray. Add cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, diced tomatoes and green chiles, cream cheese, Velveeta, broth, onion powder, salt, and pepper; mix well. Nestle chicken breasts into soup mixture and cover with the lid.</li>
        <li>Cook on Low for about 3 1/2 hours or until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a clean cutting board and allow it to cool slightly. Once chicken is cooled enough to handle, shred it and return to the soup mixture. Add Colby Jack and stir until evenly coated. Cover with lid and turn off heat, let sit until cheese is mostly melted, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cook spaghetti according to package directions. </li>
        <li>Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking water; set cooking water aside. Add pasta to slow cooker, stirring until evenly coated. Add a little more cooking water if necessary to maintain a creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
